title: What's this?
---

To us, news and the conversations around them are a cornerstone of democracy, an essential ingredient open societies cannot flourish without. 

To many of our readers, it's - a product. Like a pain pill or a piece of meat. Something you need and want, but still, sometimes, 
thinking about the industry that produces it leaves you in state of worry. 


So we decided to develop our prototype from this perspective.  It's a consumer's guide for the news industry and its products.

We owe the gist of this idea to the guys at WNYC and their show [On The Media](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/otm). 
They do their [breaking news consumer handbooks](http://www.wnyc.org/story/breaking-news-consumers-handbook-pdf/) in audio and PDF - we're doing code.
